            NOTICE: This document is a legally binding agreement between Ranasinghe Infrastructure System ("the Company") and the individual or corporate entity ("User") accessing our architectural assets. This policy is designed to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and the Sri Lanka Personal Data Protection Act No. 9 of 2022.
        </div>

        <h1>Global Privacy & Data Protection Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 28, 2025</p>
        <p><strong>Document ID:</strong> RIS-LEG-POL-2025-09</p>

        <h2>1. Scope of Policy</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Ranasinghe Infrastructure System (collectively, “RIS”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, and discloses information in the context of our Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) products, professional consulting services, and our relationship with our authorized Merchant of Record (MoR) partners, including FastSpring and WarriorPlus.</p>

        <h2>2. Data Collection & Information Sovereignty</h2>
        <p>In the course of delivering high-ticket enterprise assets, we process data categorized under the following headings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personally Identifiable Information (PII):</strong> This includes, but is not limited to, legal names, business registration numbers (where applicable), and corporate email addresses used for license generation.</li>
            <li><strong>Infrastructure Metadata:</strong> When using our automated setup scripts (`setup.sh`), we may process project names and AWS region preferences. We do NOT collect AWS Secret Keys or Access Keys.</li>
            <li><strong>Transaction Telemetry:</strong> Data provided by our Merchant of Record partners regarding purchase history, licensing status, and renewal dates.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Role of the Merchant of Record (MoR)</h2>
        <p>RIS utilizes third-party Resellers (FastSpring/WarriorPlus) to handle global payments. These entities act as the "Data Controller" for financial information. RIS is the "Data Processor" for license fulfillment. We never see, store, or have access to your full credit card numbers or banking authentication tokens. All such data is processed on PCI-DSS Level 1 compliant infrastructure managed by the Reseller.</p>

        <h2>4. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Compliance</h2>
        <p>For users located in the European Economic Area (EEA), RIS adheres to the following principles:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
            <li><strong>Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency:</strong> We process data only when there is a legal basis (e.g., contract fulfillment).</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose Limitation:</strong> Data is collected for the sole purpose of architectural delivery and security audit logging.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> We do not collect "nice-to-have" data; only what is critical for the $1,200 enterprise license to function.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) Disclosure</h2>
        <p>RIS does not "sell" personal information as defined by the CCPA. We do not exchange personal data for monetary or other valuable consideration. California residents have the right to request a disclosure of what data is held and the right to request deletion ("Right to be Forgotten"), provided such deletion does not interfere with legal compliance or active license verification.</p>

        <h2>6. Security and Data Retention Logic</h2>
        <p>We retain PII only as long as the license is active. In the event of an "IP Buyout," data is retained for the duration of the copyright hold (70 years in some jurisdictions) to verify the legal transfer of ownership. All data at rest is encrypted using AES-256 standards, mirroring the security hardening found within our Terraform products.</p>

        <h2>7. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>As a Sri Lanka-based entity serving global clients, your data may be transferred to servers located in the United States or Singapore. By using our services, you consent to this trans-border data flow, which is protected under Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs).</p>

        <h2>8. Dispute Resolution and Contact</h2>
        <p>Any concerns regarding data privacy should be directed to our Data Protection Officer (DPO) at: <strong>legal@ranasingheinfrastructure.com</strong>. We commit to responding to all formal inquiries within 15 business days as required by international law.</p>
